# The Generator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea behind the generator is to help keep user from wasting time copying and pasting information from one place to another in great numbers or attempting to check large numbers of data with just a human eye. These programs are heavily pattern based. In order for the programs to work there must be a pattern for the system to work on.
